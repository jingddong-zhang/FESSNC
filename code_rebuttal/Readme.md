This directory contains the supplementary numerical experiments in the rebuttal process.

The **3-link pendulum** directory contains the implementation of FESSNC, Kernel Machine based controller (Rectified flow model+controller), and FESS+Kernel in stabilizing the noise perturbed 3-link pendulum task. Run **train.py** to obtain the neural controller for FESSNC. The **kernel_machine.py** contains the Kernel controller class, run **generate.py** to obtain the sampled trajectories of three controllers and the analysis of the results.

The **kinetic bicycle_comparison+ablation** directory contains the implementation of ablation study and comparison with the existing learning-based methods. Run **train_RSM.py** to obtain the neural controller for RSMC. Run **train_sync.py** to obtain the neural controller for SYNC. Run **train_controlbarrier.py** to obtain the neural controller for NNDMC. Run **train_ablation.py** to obtain the neural controllers and the corresponding controlled trajectories under different hyparparameters combinations.
